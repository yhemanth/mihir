    Airbus SE (/ˈɛərbʌs/; French: [ɛʁbys] (About this soundlisten); German: [ˈɛːɐ̯bʊs] (About this soundlisten); Spanish: [ˈejɾbus]) is a European[8] multinational aerospace corporation. As of 2019, Airbus is the world's largest airliner manufacturer and took the most airliner orders.[9] It designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aerospace products worldwide and manufactures aircraft in the European Union and various other countries. The company has three divisions: Commercial Aircraft (Airbus S.A.S.), Defence and Space, and Helicopters, the third being the largest in its industry in terms of revenues and turbine helicopter deliveries.[10]

The company's main civil aeroplane business is conducted through the French company Airbus S.A.S.,[11] based in Blagnac, a suburb of Toulouse, with production and manufacturing facilities mostly in Europe (France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom) but also in China, the United States and Canada. Final assembly production is based in Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Seville, Spain; Tianjin, China; Mobile, United States; and Montreal, Canada.[12] The company produces and markets the first commercially viable digital fly-by-wire airliner, the Airbus A320,[13][14] and the world's largest passenger airliner, the A380. The 12,000th aircraft, an A220, was delivered to Delta Air Lines on 20 May 2019.[15] By October 2016, the global Airbus fleet have performed more than 110 million flights, totalling over 215 billion kilometres and carrying 12 billion passengers.[16]
    Let us learn about the History of Airbus</font></p>

<p style="font-size:45px" align="left"><b><underline><font face="monospace">History</b></p>
<p style="font-size:16px" align="justify"><font face="monospace"> The current company is the product of consolidation in the European aerospace industry tracing back to the formation of the Airbus Industrie GIE consortium in 1970. In 2000, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) NV was established. In addition to other subsidiaries pertaining to security and space activities, EADS owned 100% of the pre-existing Eurocopter SA, established in 1992, as well as 80% of Airbus Industrie GIE. In 2001, Airbus Industrie GIE was reorganised as Airbus SAS, a simplified joint-stock company. In 2006, EADS acquired BAE Systems's remaining 20% of Airbus.[18] EADS NV was renamed Airbus Group NV and SE in 2014, and 2015, respectively.[19][20][21] Due to the dominance of the Airbus SAS division within Airbus Group SE, the executive committees of the parent and subsidiary companies were aligned in January 2017, but the companies were kept as separate legal entities. The holding company was given its present name in April 2017.[22]</font></p>

<p style="font-size:30px" align="left"><b><underline><font face="monospace">A220</b></p><p style="font-size:16px" align="justify"><font face="monospace">
<p style="font-size:16px" align="justify"><font face="monospace">The smaller variant (CS100 then A220-100), seating 108 to 133, made its maiden flight on 16 September 2013, was awarded an initial type certification by Transport Canada on 18 December 2015, and entered service on 15 July 2016 with Swiss Global Air Lines. The longer variant (CS300 then A220-300), seating 130 to 160, first flew on 27 February 2015, received an initial type certification on 11 July 2016, and entered service with launch customer airBaltic on 14 December 2016.

In July 2018, the aircraft was rebranded as the A220 after Airbus acquired 50.01% of the programme through a joint venture, which was later renamed Airbus Canada Limited Partnership. In August 2019, a second final assembly line opened at Airbus Mobile, supplementing the initial Mirabel facility. In February 2020, Airbus increased its share to 75% as Bombardier exited the programme, while the provincial government's Investissement Québec held the 25% balance.

Powered by Pratt & Whitney PW1000G geared turbofans, the twinjet has fly-by-wire flight controls, a carbon composite wing and an aluminium-lithium fuselage.

Early operators, Swiss and airBaltic, recorded better-than-expected fuel burn and dispatch reliability, as well as positive feedback from passengers and crew. Delta Air Lines is currently the largest operator with 46 airplanes in its fleet.[4] As of January 2021, a total of 630 aircraft had been ordered of which 146 had been delivered.[3] The A220 family complements the A319neo in the Airbus range and competes with the largest variants of the Embraer E-Jet E2 family and the smaller Boeing 737 MAX-7 variant.</font></p>
